            * The FixedArray storage stores location in a huge array. The size of
            * the array is given when initializing the object, it must be large
            * enough to hold all items. It is not possible to resize the array
            * later.
            *
            * Only use this store when you know beforehand how many IDs there are.
            * It is mainly provided for cases where the more flexible MmapAnon
            * storage class does not work.
            *
            * If you are storing node coordinates, you'll need 8 bytes for each node.
            * At the time of writing this, the largest node ID is about 2.4 billion,
            * so you'll need about 20 GB of memory.
            *
            * Note that this storage class will only work on 64 bit systems if
            * used for storing node coordinates. 32 bit systems just can't address
            * that much memory!
